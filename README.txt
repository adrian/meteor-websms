Installation
--------
    * Extract the tarball/zip

    * Meteor are using an in-house generated SSL certificate rather than one
      from a Certification Authority such as Verisign. For this reason we need
      to add their certificate to our KeyStore of trusted certificates. To do
      this copy the bundled file 'jssecacerts' into the .\lib\security folder
      of your JRE,
      (something like C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_02\lib\security)
